                                <blockquote>Up until the last 200 years, everyone was a freelancer, entrepreneur, or indentured. Of course, entrepreneurship is a learnable skill. - Richie Norton</blockquote>
                                
                                <h3 class="mt-24">Even as a solo entrepreneur my clients must treat me as a business</h3>
                                <p class="grey-text">Just because I'm not an agency with plenty of people working on their project doesn't mean I'm not a business. My potential clients know from the first introduction, whether it's my website or a handshake with me in person I am about business. To further set the stage, I create a proposal, project scope, and a contract to ensure we are on the same page with expectations. Make sure your clients are a good fit for you and vice versa before contracts are signed. </p>

                                <h3 class="mt-24">Don't be scared of your tools</h3>
                                <p class="grey-text">Everything I can automate using software makes life easier for the client and myself. For example, instead of hiring an accountant, I use <a href="https://www.hellobonsai.com/invite?fp_ref=viachaz" target="_blank" class="text-link">Bonsai</a>. Bonsai tracks my expenses, allows me to create beautiful proposals, project scopes also lawyer approved contracts. I save thousands of dollars per month using the software as a tool and improves my
                                workflow substantially. </p>

                                <h3 class="mt-24">Time invested at the start of projects saves future headaches</h3>
                                <p class="grey-text">Before I send out proposals, project scopes, and contracts, I go through an in-depth conversation with my potential client. You don't want to start a project and realize you aren't competent enough to complete it or not on the same page with your client. Time is your most valuable asset.</p>

                                <h3 class="mt-24">Happy clients are free organic marketing</h3>
                                <p class="grey-text">A great deal of freelancers receives their clients through referrals. To receive a referral, your client believes you have done an outstanding job. Communication is a tried and true way to obtain this. Throughout projects, keep your client in the loop to ensure they understand where you are and going. This process eliminates disappointment and excessive revisions. Upon completion of a satisfactory project, ask your client for a testimonial, and about referral
                                opportunities. Businesses thrive off social proof, and now you have it! </p>

                                <h3 class="mt-24">Find your niche, and grow from there</h3>
                                <p class="grey-text">Predominantly my websites are focused on the health and wellness sector. I use being an athlete as a strength to niche
                                down into that market. Upon talking to potential clients, the knowledge I've obtained relates to them. This niche is rapidly growing, which has allowed me to expand my offers further than only local gyms. I recommend looking into your interests, picking something, and start capitalizing on pain points.</p>

                                <h3 class="mt-24">Be honest</h3>
                                <p class="grey-text">If there's something that you can't do, be upfront. If a project doesn't excite you, don't do it. Respectfully say you're not the person for the job. It's seldom worth doing something just for the money. If a client needs photography, politely say I'm not a photographer and layout options that can resolve the issue. Lastly, when you aren't going to meet a deadline, please tell them early on. You can ruin your relationship, more importantly, their business. If you do miss
                                a deadline, add something extra to the project to show you care.</p>

                                <h3 class="mt-24">Refine</h3>
                                <p class="grey-text">Erase irrelevant things regardless if you love them. On the off chance that it isn't fantastic, it gets cut. Be a heartless refiner. Savage. Erase. Refine. Improve.</p>
                            
                                <h3 class="mt-24">Have your own website</h3>
                                <p class="grey-text">Personal websites are a credible resource that everyone needs. They're the one thing on the internet that's yours. Social media platforms are predicated on the company that operates them. You can do the same thing with your website. With your website, you can showcase your work in one place, collect emails, and ensure your clients can find you.</p>

                                <h3 class="mt-24">Create content</h3>
                                <p class="grey-text">The medium is your choice. If you enjoy writing, blogging may work best for you. You love talking, but don't want to learn video editing, create a podcast. It will be scary at first, but once you become competent and realize people can relate to you, your anxiety will begin to ease. Once again, it builds trust by showing you as a credible resource.</p>
