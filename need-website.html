                                <p>Unless you're an entrepreneur who isn't interested in developing your brand, you have to have a website. Having a website isn't just about selling your merchandise and services — it's likewise about giving something of significant worth to potential clients.</p>
                                
                                <h3 class="mt-24">It’s often the first thing people see</h3>
                                <p class="grey-text"> After typing your name or business in Google, your website shows up and should be able to inform me on everything I need to know. First impressions count, and they’re often impossible to erase.</p>

                                <h3 class="mt-24">More customization than social media networks</h3>
                                <p class="grey-text">Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social networks don't offer much customizability. So there's only so much of your personality you can infuse into your profile pages. Your website, however, is all yours. Design it however you like, create the type of content you want, and infuse as much of your personality as possible.</p>

                                <h3 class="mt-24">Determines your legitimacy</h3>
                                <p class="grey-text">A good website will change someone’s perception of who you are and what you do. It’s one of the best marketing moves you will make. Be aware that you want your website to look and feel modern, be mobile-friendly, to include social media integration, and a distinct call-to-action. Missing these features will immediately diminish your credibility and make
                                you look like an amateur.</p>

                                <h3 class="mt-24">Building for the long-term</h3>
                                <p class="grey-text">Customers and influential people will look at your site and make decisions about the quality of your art, seriousness, and potential. They will use your website and the information provided to decide whether they should pass opportunities to you or shop with you.</p>

                                <h3 class="mt-24">all your information in one place</h3>
                                <p class="grey-text">YouTube does videos really well. Twitter does 280 character statements incredibly well. Facebook is an expert at fan engagement. But a website allows you to bring those 3 elements together and even more!</p>

                                <h3 class="mt-24">Websites bring better gigs</h3>
                                <p class="grey-text">Whether you believe or not, having a good website is the difference between playing a bar gig at a music festival or playing the outdoor stage. It’s all about the opinion of people who can make things move for you.</p>
                            
                                <h3 class="mt-24">Because some people aren’t on Facebook</h3>
                                <p class="grey-text">With the issues Facebook had recently, a lot of people are deleting or not checking their accounts as much. A website is a place on the web that anyone can reach with a low commitment.</p>

                                <h3 class="mt-24">The difference between a career and a hobby</h3>
                                <p class="grey-text">Websites are proof you are about your business. If you tell someone you're a photographer, a website showcases your best work and gives an outlet to contact you later. You don't want anything to block you from receiving an opportunity.</p>
